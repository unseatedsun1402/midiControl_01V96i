# midiControl_01V96i
Python program using pygame to connect to Yamaha 01V96i Digital mixing desk and provide control over Midi for various parameters

Currently under heavy development and non-functional

When the program is capable of sending and recieving meaningful data (i.e. can make changes to the desk setting) then the project will enter preRelease.

When the ui is functional then the project will be under alpha release.

Goals for Version 1.0:
  *A program that can read desk parameters live and display them as well as allowing the user to make changes to the settings.
  
  *A graphical user interface emulating real-world controls (such as knobs and faders)
  
  *A server function for multiple simultaneous mobile devices to make edits/see parameters live.
